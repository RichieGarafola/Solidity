    "Smart contract are distributed. - Everyone on the blockchain network validates the terms of the contract.\n",

    "**Introduction to smart contract**\n",
    "if one pary to the contract or member of the blockchain networks tries to override the terms of the contract by trying to trigger an early release of funds, the other network members will recognize the change to the contract as invalid and prevent the action. \n",

    "**Solidity and Remix**\n",
    "Solidity code is consdiered particularly human readable with characteristics that resemble those of both Python and JavaScript\n",
    "When a soliditiy smart contract runs, the program first gets compiled.\n",
    "This means that its onverted from human-readable syntax into a computer-friendly version of the code, called bytecode\n",
    "once compiled, the code runs in the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The EVM is a software platform that is embedded in each node of the Ethereum blockchain network. The EVM runs the bytecode that results from running a solidity smart contract. \n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**A key benefit of using the EVM**\n",
    "The EVM offers an isolated enviornment in which Solidity code an run - without accessing the computer network, files, or other resources of the host computer.\n",
    "This means that by using the same instructions, each decentralized node on the Ethereum blockchain can validate the smart contract. The EVM is thus essential to the consensus mechanism of the Etherem blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a consensus mechanism allows the nodes of the Ethereum blockchin to work together to both stay secure and reach an agreement on the current state of the blockchain.\n",

    "**Remix IDE**\n",
    "we use this IDE for solidity, just like we use an IDE for python. But instead of using Visual Studio Code or JupyterLab we will use Remix IDE\n",
    "\n",
    "The Remix IDE is an open source application for developing deploying and administering smart contrcts that run on ethereum based blockchains. we can use this ide for the entire development cycle of smart contracts and as a playground for teaching and learning Ethereum\n",
    "The Remix IDE is available in both web and desktop versions For both web and desktop versions. For better compatibility among operating systems, we will use the web version of the Remix IDE.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because Remix is an open source application, the Remix IDE is under constant development, and its user interface often gets updated. So, the interface in the current live version might vary from slides that appear in this lesson. \n",

    "Solidity syntax differs a bit from Python syntax. Thats partly because Solidity is an object - oriented programming language\n",
